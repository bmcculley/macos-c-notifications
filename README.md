# Mac OS User Notifications from C

This will enable the sending of user notifications from pure C. This repo 
is setup to send them from the command line.

## Usage

 * Download the repo
  * `git clone https://github.com/bmcculley/macos-c-notifications.git`
 * Move into the directory and run make
  * `cd macos-c-notifications && make`

Note: I am assuming that you have a c compiler installed on your system.

### Thank you

This project is originally forked from Jeremy Legendre's 
[NS-C-UserNotification](https://github.com/jslegendre/NS-C-UserNotification). 
Big thanks to him for such a head start.
